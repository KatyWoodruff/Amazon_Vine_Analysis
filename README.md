### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
0% of the 5 star reviews were from the paid Vine reviews and 64% were from the unpaid reviews


## Summary:
